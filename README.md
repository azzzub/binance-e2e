- Npm v10.8.2 or higher
- Make
- Binance API Key

## Setup
1. Install the dependencies
```bash
make setup

## Generate Keys
**Note:** This step is only required if you don't have a Binance API Key
1. Generate private and public keys
```bash
make generate_key
```
2. Public key and private key will be generated and located in the root folder
